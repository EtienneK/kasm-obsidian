# Kasm Obsidian

A Kasm Workspace image for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

# Please Note

This is currently using the KASM `develop` base image. I will switch to a prod base on the next Kasm major release.

For now, though, you can configure Kasm to use my `etiennek/kasm-obsidian:develop` image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/etiennek/kasm-obsidian). This Obsidian logo from Wikipedia works nice as a Thumbnail Image: <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/2023_Obsidian_logo.svg>
