# Kasm Obsidian

A Kasm Workspace image for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

# Please Note

This is currently using the KASM `develop` base image. I will switch to a prod base on the next Kasm major release.

For now, though, you can configure Kasm to use my `etiennek/kasm-obsidian:develop` image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/etiennek/kasm-obsidian).
